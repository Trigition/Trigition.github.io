        <p>
            Oh sweetie, you make me feel so precious and wanted.
        The very least I could do is to make you feel the same;
        I want to do that (and so much more). Your emails made me
        feel better. I can't say that mine will have the same effect...
        I'd like to try.</p>
        <p>
            So hopefully this email was formatted correctly.
            I wanted to mess around with what CSS in emails could
            do. Turns out, it's a pretty complicated process only
            because some executives made mistakes (and continue to)
            about how emails should be displayed in internet browsers.
        </p>
        <p>
            In short emails use a limited form of styling. And
            no two email clients (like Gmail or Apple Mail)
            agree on how the email is rendered. Luckily for me
            I know you use Gmail so testing this wasn't bad.
        </p>
        <p>
            Why do this? Well I wanted to send you some photos
            and I hate how Gmail doesn't give too many options
            on styling my email...so I decided to do it myself!
            And, when I arrive, my family and friends would like
            some photos to send back and I think it would be nice
            if the email was formatted. Also I could upload the
            photos to some file hosting service and link the image
            in the email so the email size isn't gigantic.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wow this seems like a long email. I don't normally
            write emails of this length. But this was fun! Maybe I
            could send some kind of interactive JavaScript application
            to you when you're bored!
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm not sure if you've seen the new Star Wars, but here
            is an animated BB-8 made in CSS (I wish my skills were this
            good.)
        </p>
        <p>
            With all my love <br />
