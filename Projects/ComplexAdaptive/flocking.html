    <h1>Flocking</h1>
    <h3>How Simple Rules Lead to Complex Behavior</h3>
    <div class="maincontent">
      <p>
        Complex Adaptive Systems can also be used to demonstrate how
        behaviors in animals arise. In this case we look at bird flocking.
        In the case of bird delta formations, it was commonly believed 
        that the bird at the front was the "leader". However this meant
        there was some form of hierarchical social structure that was not
        seen in many bird flocks.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the lack of evidence for leadership in bird flocks, it was
        proposed that birds may only be concerned about their distance to
        other birds and their heading.
      </p>
      <h4>The Rules</h4>
      <div class="rules">
        <ul>
          <li>A bird must maintain its distance to its neighbor to the best of its ability.</li>
          <li>A bird must adjust its heading towards the rest of the flock (by averaging)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
        Just by these 2 rules, we can see recognizable patterns of bird formations.
        Running the code below provides a good example of how these patterns emerge.
