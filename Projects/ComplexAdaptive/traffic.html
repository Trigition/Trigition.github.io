    <h1>Traffic Modelling</h1>
    <h3>A Practical Use of Complex Systems</h3>
    <div class="maincontent">
      <p>Everybody hates traffic <sup>Citation Needed</sup>. But this 
        annoying pattern can be modelled using complex systems. By
        representing cars and traffic lights as their own entities, we 
        can show how the environment (road topology) and timing can cause
        immensly different outcomes.
      </p>
      <h4>The Cars</h4>
      <p>
        The cars follow rules that every (responsible) driver will follow.
        They will not collide with another car. They will only pass an
        intersection when the light is green. This is the only behavior
        governing the cars.
      </p>
      <h4>The Lights</h4>
      <p>
        The traffic lights act a little smarter than a timed traffic light.
        They change their status according to the number of cars waiting in
        line. A single traffic light is not concerned with the status
        of neighboring intersections. A traffic light is only considering
        the cars waiting on its own signal.
      </p>
      <h4>Powerloss</h4>
      <p>
        This model include the option to cause a power-loss to the network,
        forcing everyone to treat the intersection as a 4-way stop. With this
        option enabled, we can see how the average wait time for every car 
        starts to climb.
